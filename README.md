# OpenDataCube For NDVI and LAI 

## Introduction
The Open Data Cube (ODC) is an open-source geospatial data management and analysis platform designed for working with large, multi-dimensional Earth observation (EO) and remote sensing data. NDVI and LAI are very important vegetation indices which contribute greatly in the monitoring of vegetation health and density. In this project, we assessed the ODC from Microsoft Planetory Computer. This project aims to assess ODC data collection over a region in Ghana, Janga and compute for the NDVI and LAI for 2020 and 2023 respectively. 

## Study Area
Janga is a town located in the northeastern part of Ghana, specifically in the North East Region. It is situated at latitude 10°01'52"N and longitude 00°58'37"W.

## Method
I wrote a python script which assesses Sentinel 2A data from microsoft planetory computer ODC. Loaded the bands and performed math on them to compute the NDVI and LAI values of the studio region for 2023 and 2020 respectively. Then went ahead and computed the mean and standard deviations for the NDVI and LAI values and generated a histogram plot to compare the results. You can see the full script in the Scripts folder in this repository.
